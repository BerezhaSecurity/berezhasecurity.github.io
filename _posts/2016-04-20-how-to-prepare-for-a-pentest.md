This may seem counterintuitive, but yes, the pentesters, I mean the good ones, want you to come prepared. It does not make a lot of sense to order a penetration test (or any type of security assessment) _before_ you actually do something to protect your company _and_ perform some self-checks. And from the other side, doing the "regular stuff" and reporting poor SSL practices and web-server misconfigurations isâ€¦ kind of not fun, you know?

So, how could you perform a self-assessment of your organization's security posture and increase the quality of the third party pentest that follows? (While making your pentester's work more challenging and fun, of course).

### 1. Use that fancy cloud of yours
Many companies are adopting cloud services these days and if you are one of them, it is time to leverage your cloud provider's security functionality. Enabling two-step verification in Google Mail can be an example, setting up [Boxcryptor](https://www.boxcryptor.com/en) for your file sharing service is another one. If you are using Amazon AWS to host your web properties, there is plenty of security features you can choose from, it's a topic for a whole another post or even a book though. In any case, enable that security feature you always thought about but delayed for some reason.

### 2. Use CloudFlare for your public websites
CloudFlare's mission is to secure the web and it's doing quite well. More then 2 000 000 websites are already using it for protection so why not give it a try? If you are not yet familiar with it, you can imagine [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) as a super-charged reverse proxy for your web-site that protects it by filtering out malicious activity. It has a free option that is quite enough for most personal websites, and business subscription plans provide much more functionality.

### 3. Learn how to setup your SSL correctly and for free
Getting rid of all those pesky SSL errors, like the cert is self-signed or its name is incorrect, is quite boring and requires a buck or two. But wait, does it really? In fact, there are a few ways to get your website a new shiny green URL padlock without paying anything at all and almost zero effort. First, this is another reason to use CloudFlare: it has several modes of SSL protection available for free. Second, if you have some time and like playing around with open source software, try [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org): a free and easily automated way to get certificates signed by a trusted CA.

### 4. Check your systems for known vulnerabilities
Experienced pentesters use automation tools, however, they don't fully rely on their results. These tools are numerous with [Nmap](https://nmap.org) and [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-vulnerability-scanner) being two widespread examples you can use for vulnerability self-assessment. Nmap, initially a network mapping tool, has recently become a sophisticated vulnerability analysis toolkit with many so called plugins available out of the box. Nessus is much easier to use and it has a 7 day trial period. We recommend using it (or an alternative product) continuously to monitor your assets for vulnerabilities and fixing them on a timely basis. Pay attention to the network load and possible operation incidents that security testing tools may cause: agree on the time and scope with your devops and _don't do evil_.

Hope these steps can help you prepare for your next pentest and get the most value out of it. As usual, be careful with using security tools and always have permission of the legal owner of the resources being tested :)
